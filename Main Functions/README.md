# CS433 Project 1 : Main folder

This folder contains all the main functions we use in order to reproduce the results we submitted to Kaggle.

## Data:
Plase place the data files:
 - Either in this repository directly
 - Or in a folder named `data` placed in this repository


## Implemented functions: 

Here you will find the implementations of the six algorithms we were asked to implementing the file `implementations.py`.

All the additional functions needed for their implementation are in the file called `proj1_helpers.py`.

In addition we created a new file named `feature_engineering`. This is where all the functions needed for cleaning and generating the data can be found.

    
## Running the python script: 

You can run the command `python run.py` and wait for it to generate the results in a file named `predictions.csv`.
